== Description ==

= Details =

Visitors with enabled JavaScript (99%+) see nothing â€“ no annoying questions, no captcha, nothing. (Users with disabled JS see an additional text-field and a word that must be rewritten into the textfield.)

*Note*: this plugin is not able to check your trackbacks - to handle trackback spam, it's necessary to use some other solution. (I recommend to disable trackbacks globally, since they rarely bring any benefit for your readers.) [more...](http://kahi.cz/wordpress/ravens-antispam-plugin/).
