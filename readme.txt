Powerful and invisible fighter against comment spam.

== Description ==

Raven's antispam is a Wordpress plugin, powerful and invisible fighter against comment spam.

Visitors with enabled JavaScript (99%+) see nothing â€“ no annoying questions, no captcha, nothing. (Users with disabled JS see an additional text-field and a word that must be rewritten into textfield.)

Note: this plugin is not able to check your trackbacks - to handle trackback spam, it's necessary to use some other solution. [See my recommendations](http://kahi.cz/wordpress/ravens-antispam-plugin/)
